inspired by the Mathologer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7Q8IWNfHM)

this was my homework as a christmas gift

# controls
two modes: manual and automatic (switch between both via right arrow key)
in manual mode: press space bar for the next iteration

# laggy
because of a constant time for a full move and integer coordinates it can appear quite laggy with more and more tiles
there is also a very naive data structure for keeping track of the tiles
